## 🌟 Features / Highlights
### 🛠️ Business Problem
Kickstarter faces a fundamental challenge: the majority of campaigns fail to meet their funding goals. Many creators launch projects without understanding which categories succeed, what funding targets are realistic, or how timing and geography impact results. This lack of insight leads to poor planning, unmet expectations, and inefficient allocation of backers’ support.

### 🎯 Goal of the Project
To provide data-driven insights into Kickstarter’s ecosystem by visualizing trends in campaign success, funding amounts, backer behavior, and category performance. This dashboard aims to help creators launch smarter campaigns, backers make informed decisions, and analysts identify patterns in crowdfunding success across time and geography.
